# Diabetics Prediction - Data Mining Project	Jan 2023 â€“ Mar 2023
A machine learning model for predicting the possibility of Diabetics.
-	Utilized Scikit-learn packages to train 7 classification models and determined the optimal model with the highest accuracy through a K-Folds Cross-Validation method by comparing the average accuracy values presented in a boxplot chart.
-	Optimized model performance by leveraging GridSearchCV and RandomSearchCV to obtain the appropriate parameters. Achieved 3% improvement in accuracy and resolved overfitting issues in training set.
-	Applied the capabilities of Pandas and NumPy packages to impute the missing values with the median value for the features, scaled the outliers, refined the dataset, and optimized the modeling.
